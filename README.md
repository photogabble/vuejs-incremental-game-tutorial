This is the source code for the Vue.js Incrememnetal Game Tutorial series on PhotoGabble.

## Part One
_Published May 3rd 2018_: [Tutorial](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/blog/tutorials/build-an-incremental-web-game-with-vue-js/) | [Branch](https://github.com/photogabble/vuejs-incremental-game-tutorial/tree/tutorial-part-1) | [PR](https://github.com/photogabble/vuejs-incremental-game-tutorial/pull/1)

By the end of the first part the game is ugly but "playable" and incorporates the majority of the mechanics that the original _BASIC Space Mines_ game had. However there is a lot missing for example if you stop selling ore to buy food then you will eventually run out of food and colonists and in its present state you can only have one mine.

## Part Two
_Unpublished_: Tutorial | [Branch](https://github.com/photogabble/vuejs-incremental-game-tutorial/tree/tutorial-part-2) | PR

In this part we expand upon the concept of _colonists_ beyond them simply being a number and begin taking into consideration their experience in mining as a factor in how much they can mine. We also add a reusable data structure for buildings as a precursor to adding more of them later on.

## Part Three
_Unpublished_: Tutorial | Branch | PR

In this part we work on adding three new buildings: the first of our habitation buildings, the science Lab and a greenhouse. As well as the beginning of the tech tree for research. We will also begin differentiating between colonists and crew, your crew can be hired/fired by the player from a random pool of candidates while colonists are transient in nature and will come and go with the passing of time (depending upon overal satisfaction.)
