This is the source code for the Vue.js Incrememnetal Game Tutorial series on PhotoGabble.

## Part One
[Tutorial](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/blog/tutorials/build-an-incremental-web-game-with-vue-js/) | [Branch](https://github.com/photogabble/vuejs-incremental-game-tutorial/tree/tutorial-part-1) | [PR](https://github.com/photogabble/vuejs-incremental-game-tutorial/pull/1)

By the end of the first part we will have completed the basic mechanics of the game. 

By the end of the first part the game is ugly but "playable" and incorporates the majority of the mechanics that the original _BASIC Space Mines_ game had. However there is a lot missing for example if you stop selling ore to buy food then you will eventually run out of food and colonists and in its present state you can only have one mine.
